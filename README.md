I created this AWS serverless application while I was preparing for the AWS Developer Associate and Terraform Associate certifications to validate the knowledge and experience I've gained on the job. This application is sunset. The associated AWS and Terraform Cloud accounts have been closed, and the CI/CD options (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) are disabled so no costs can accrue.
